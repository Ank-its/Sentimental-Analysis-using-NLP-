# Stock Market Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of stock market data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The key components include a Decision Tree model implemented in Python, stored in the 'models' directory, and a web application ('web_app.py') for interactive exploration. 

## Project Structure

- `data`: Contains datasets such as 'Combined_News_DJIA.csv' and 'RedditNews.csv'.
- `models`: Holds saved models, including 'LDA_model_improved.pkl' and 'LDA_saved_model.pkl'.
- `modeling.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for exploring and building the sentiment analysis model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies for easy environment setup.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Explore sentiment analysis models in the 'modeling.ipynb' notebook.
4. Run the web application using `python web_app.py`.

**Note:**
- For detailed information on the datasets and models, refer to 'README.md'.
- Find additional details and usage instructions within the project files.
